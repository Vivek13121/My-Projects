# Snake Game using Python Turtle

## Project Description

This project is a classic Snake Game implemented using Python's Turtle module. The Snake Game is a fun and engaging game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen edges or into its own tail.

## Features

- **Simple and Intuitive Gameplay**: Easy to play with straightforward controls.
- **Dynamic Snake Movement**: The snake moves smoothly and can grow in length.
- **Collision Detection**: Game ends if the snake collides with the screen edges or itself.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score, which increases as the snake eats more food.
- **Food Generation**: Randomly places food on the screen for the snake to eat.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `snake_game.py` file to start the game.
2. **Control the Snake**: Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
   - **Up Arrow**: Move Up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move Down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move Left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move Right
3. **Eat the Food**: Guide the snake to the food to eat it and grow longer.
4. **Avoid Collisions**: Prevent the snake from hitting the walls or its own tail.
5. **Game Over**: If the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game is over, and the final score is displayed.
