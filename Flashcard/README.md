# Flashcard Project

This interactive Python application helps users learn vocabulary through flashcards. It presents French words and prompts users to recall their English translations.

## Features
- Randomly selects a French word from a dataset.
- Flips the card after 3 seconds to reveal the English translation.
- Allows users to mark a card as "known" or skip to the next word.
- Saves progress by removing known words from future sessions.
- Utilizes Tkinter for GUI and Pandas for data handling.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install necessary dependencies (`pandas`).
3. Run the application using Python (`python flashcard.py`).
4. Click the green checkmark if you know the translation or the red cross to skip to the next word.
